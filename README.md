Titanic Survival Analysis & Data Cleaning 🚢📊

Overview 📝

This repository contains a data analysis and cleaning project based on the Titanic dataset. The project uses Python for visual exploration of survival patterns and performs data preprocessing for potential use in machine learning models.

Project Details 📈

The analysis explores how survival chances varied across different features such as age, sex, class, and fare. It also includes cleaning steps like handling missing values, extracting titles from names, and removing irrelevant columns.

Key Findings:

👩‍🦰 Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

🎟️ First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class.

👶 Younger passengers had relatively better survival chances.

💵 Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more.
